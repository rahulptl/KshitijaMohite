                    <h2>Title : Don a research</h2>

                    <h4>Objectives: </h4>
                    <p>To prove that she is not only someone who introduced me Asian drama, not only someone who helped me with my blue hair , not only somone who helped me with my towed Activa . But her confidence, grace , personality is something I aspire
                        to have some day .</p>

                    <h4>Hypothesis: </h4>
                    <p>The quote " beauty attracts the eye but personality captured the heart" she probably owns it . </p>

                    <h4>Materials Required: </h4>
                    <p>Don , her phone , boat bluetooth earphones, coffee , blue bag, sleeping mask , Shein , red bowed chappals</p>

                    <h4>Methods: </h4>
                    <p>Participant observation</p>

                    <h4>Procedure: </h4>
                    <p>First time was my towed Activa and the way she was ready to fight for a person she literally heard from her brother two hours ago . Second time was when the blue on her hair was recent and she was near my apartment ( location will
                        not be known) to pick her brother up . I remember complimenting her hair while she was standing on the left side of the parked car. Third time was when she came over to my house at West End Village apartments to make my hair blue
                        . While her brother left us she was successful at small talk and also paid me a visit later that day to see if the colour was perfectly applied. Fourth time was Soham's birthday where I just told her about my obsession of Chinese
                        drama. She can pull off velvet tops and bright lipsticks. McD has been the place where we met and talked a lot and where I discovered coffee obsession. The moment when she fought with Ketaki when Ketaki thought her life was unfair.
                        She advises us all about all important things and cares for us the same . The time at pirangut when we were dancing together. Findings: First incident was about giving love (#giveforlove). Second incident was all about confidence.
                        In the third incident she proves she is a successful perfectionist and a non-awkward situation maker. Fourth incident was a mark of the begining of a friendship. Next is also about confidence, beauty and grace. The later part is
                        about her values and the beautiful characteristic of not giving a fuck about what the other thinks.She tries everything she wants without the fear of peers.And lastly she displays Mother-li-ness and her adorable child like behaviour.</p>

                    <h4>Conclusion: </h4>
                    <p>She has an incredible personality and impeccable beauty. She is no more a friend's sister . She is my amma . But this amma also has a child in her, (do not jump to conclusions at this statement) she has a child-like side, which is
                        so very adorable. Happy Birthday to my nobel prize winning reasearch . 我爱你.</p>

                    <p> </p>

                    <p>It's been five years. I can't believe it. It feels like I have known you for five lifetimes. KSHITIJAAAAAA, where do I start?! These 5 texts are where our story started and rest has been history. ;) From 2014 Nov to 2015 April, I had
                        only heard about you from my family. My brother used to tell me about you, my Aatya used to constantly make it a point to mention you in every conversation we had and to be honest I was a bit jealous.. why is my family always talking
                        about you? How is my brother so amazed by you? I wanted to know more. Finally I decided to text you on your birthday and what did I know that I'll find my solace in you. I had no idea we would come such a long way. And I have no
                        complaints. I thank God for playing his small game and making sure we stick together like moth to a flame. (Shit what an example I have given, lul) We have been through hell and back. Together. And I hope I can be with you in every
                        small or big way in your life forever. ❤</p>

                    <p>This is the first time we met in Kothrud. Even though it was for 15 mins only, it was enough. I think this is 2015 Diwali. Almost 7 months after we had started talking and had become virtual buddies. Hmmm...I sense some awkwardness
                        in this picture. (First time meets are always awkward for me, you are a by far the only person I know who can turn small talk into deep conversations. You gotta TEACH ME) We are looking like babies here. Shit. Two peas in a pod.
                        🤣 PS : I had never imagined you to be sooooooo tall. I was/am the shortest person when I hangout with you guys. 🙂 Huh.</p>

                    <p>Second meet. Burger King, Phoenix Marketcity, Viman Nagar. Well it wasn't until this day we had properly "hung out". I was still very awkward during this meet. I don't know if you knew. You had brought MAD OVER DONUTS at my brother's
                        house and for the longest time my sister used to refer to as "Donuts wali didi" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 As you know, I suffer from STML, I have very faint memories from here. All I remember is that we had burgers and crushers drink and took a
                        lot of pics in the car and in the food court. Also, all my cousins accompanied me which I did not want, I wanted only you and me to hangout. 🙄🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

                    <p>I had made you wear a fake id of my clg so that you could enter my clg. 😌😇 First official MUMBAI meet 😍 I think on this day you met anvita and Ruta too for the first time. You were going through a very very rough time, I remember
                        you were crying in the clg's garden. :'( I thank god and Rahul for helping you come out of the hell you were going through. Phew. From where to where. It's really unreal.</p>

                        dadar MCD all day lonnnggggg, drew on tissue paper. I could feel that we had come so so close, you had become so important in my life. Uff I can't find proper words to describe us. I have tears in my eyes, ahhh such nostalgia.

                    <h2>Taking Sneezes <span>Nothing is out there&mdash;let's try again</span></h2>
                    <p>I am living Egypt, living.... Your pyramids and your mosques and your old Nile can talk to me of things long past and gone, and I shall listen with interest to what they have to say, but I would rather be a living dog of an Egyptian
                        than the dead lion of an Egyptian king—I would rather be a moving, talking native dressed in garish clothes than a Prince of the House of Rameses, sans eyes, sans ears, sans tongue, in the shrivelled brown form of a mummy.</p>
                    <p>For there is something about these living ones that brings the dead to life. Sometimes when I look into their eyes I seem to see a strange, mysterious light in them—a light that never was on sea or land. It is then that I think of
                        the things these people have seen in the forty centuries of which Napoleon spoke. I don't believe in magic, but I have seen strange things—things that make me remember that the magicians of Pharaoh were able to turn their rods
                        into serpents!</p>
                    <p>There came one day a very wise Egyptian—one whom I know as a Freemason—and he gave a valuable scarab, mounted in a gold ring, to Major Lynch. There was no doubt that the wise man valued it, and there is no doubt that he left an impression
                        on Major Lynch. It is a talisman and a protection to the owner, but it has deadly powers. Nothing can harm the owner so long as he has it in his possession, and the owner can shrivel up an enemy by merely pointing at him and muttering
                        incantations—just as the Northern Territory natives in Australia can will an enemy to die by pointing a bone at him. Major Lynch lost no time in putting the scarab to the test. There was a very troublesome native who used to bother
                        him several times a day about things that don't matter, and the day after the wise Egyptian had made his presentation the major pointed at the native and muttered a powerful Australian incantation. Since then the native has not
                        been seen.</p>

                    <p>One could not help contrasting this large force from Australia and New Zealand—a force that was to be doubled and trebled ere long—with the little force of 500 men which William Bede Dalley, Australian Orator and Patriot, sent from
                        New South Wales to the Sudan just thirty years before. It spoke not only of the wonderful growth in population of Britain's Dominions of the South, but it was a living proof that the years had only served to cement the bonds of
                        love and loyalty that bind the grand old Mother land to her Oversea Dominions. The rising in India, the intention of the Australians to proclaim their independence the moment when Britain found herself in peril—where were they?
                        Where now was the "disintegration" of the British Empire which the German Emperor and his War Lords had so confidently predicted?</p>
                    <p>With Cairo and the Nile safe, General Wilson was able to deal effectively with the invaders. Towards the latter end of January, Northern Sinai was overrun with them. From a couple of captured Shawishes of the 75th Turkish Regiment
                        I learned that the staff arrangements by the German officers were excellent. Everything had been foreseen and provided for—or nearly everything. Water was available at each stage of the journey across the desert. Many boats and
                        pontoons were dragged by oxen and camels along the caravan route from Kosseima, El Arish, and Nekl. A few six-inch guns were also transported to the Canal. To supplement the Turkish force on its south-westerly march all the pilgrims
                        and Bedouins met with were pressed into service and rifles were given to them.</p>
                    <p>It was on the morning of January 28 that the initial conflict took place at Kantara. A reconnoitring party from Bir El Dueidar attacked the British outposts but was repulsed, our losses being only one officer and one soldier killed
                        and five Gurkhas wounded. Further south, near Suez, a nocturnal demonstration by the Turks merely served to prove the alertness of the defenders, though unfortunately two of our air scouts met with disaster. Their aeroplane came
                        down outside our lines, and on returning on foot they were both shot dead by our own Indian patrols. The pity of it.</p>

                    <p>You had heard of the Plagues of Egypt; we have seen them, and are able to vouch for the authenticity of the Scriptures. Instead of hot cross buns, Easter brought us a plague of locusts. The entertainment started at about three o'clock
                        in the afternoon and lasted till after sundown. Millions and billions and quadrillions of locusts danced and sang for us. The air was absolutely full of them, darkening the sun—big yellow and brown and black things, mostly about
                        two inches long. They sounded like thousands of whirring wheels, and they dropped on the roofs with a noise like rain. Where they landed they left everything bare as a bone. All along the Nile the "gyppies" turned out and banged
                        tin cans to drive them off. Here was an invasion, if you like! The telegraph wires were black with them—like long beads. Some of the beautiful Ma'adi gardens were quite spoilt. These locusts of Egypt have absolutely no love for
                        the beautiful—in fact, the more beautiful a thing is the more delight do they take in devouring it.</p>
                    <p>But even a plague of locusts does not last for ever—and Egypt does. Egypt the wonderful! Egypt the kaleidoscopic! No, gentle reader, do not waste your sympathies on us. It was tiresome work, marching, training—training for the front,
                        which for months never seemed to get any nearer, and some of "the boys"—those of them who were "spoiling for a fight," as the saying is—used at times to kick over the traces and paint the town vermilion; but there are compensations
                        in Egypt for all who would seek them. What did it matter that we had no hot cross buns for Easter, no hard-boiled eggs, no ling, no salmon? We had omelettes and quail on toast, and chicken and curry and strawberries (no cream)
                        and oranges and custard and jelly and Turkish coffee and Nile fish and pancakes and fritters and iced butter and beautiful jam and marmalade—and cigars. So we managed to get "a snack," you see. And I know that I, for one, had no
                        desire just then to swap places with any man in Australia.</p>

                    <p>It was night when we got back to camp. Oh, those Egyptian nights! The winter cold has gone, and spring is in the air. The nights are fine and fair, clear and cloudless, with the moon pure silver. The reflections in the Nile are just
                        wonderful. The huge date palms stand out sharply from a star-spangled sky that somehow has a tint of green in its blue. One thinks of the Arabian Nights. The very street scenes make one think of them. Motors glide up and down the
                        streets with rich Syrians, Greeks, Egyptians, Italians, Frenchmen and Englishmen, going to the Continental, or to Shepheard's, or to private entertainments. It is a gorgeous splash of colour. They had no motor-cars that I remember
                        in those old Arabian Nights, but the magic of the thing and the colour of it all were surely much the same. And the roads of Egypt—how beautiful they are!—clean and smooth as a billiard table. Are there any finer roads in the whole
                        world than the Mena road and that to Heliopolis? Fifty miles an hour is easy. I sometimes shudder now when I recall the races that we used to have along those roads at night, crying "Egre! Egre!"—Faster! Faster!</p>

                    <h2>Beloved Mother <span>Decomposing fruits and burning houses</span></h2>
                    <p>One night stands out—a gorgeous night—a carnival in honour and aid of brave little Serbia. Kipling says that "East is east and west is west, and never the twain shall meet"; but he surely has not seen a Venetian carnival in Cairo,
                        with its intermingling of the progressive Occident and the picturesque Orient. One will always remember that. When the tourists from the West overrun the land of the Pharaohs, as they do once a year, a Venetian fête is held at
                        Shepheard's—the social event of the season. Sightseers from England, idle rich from the Continent, plutocrats from America, tourists from the four quarters of the world, all meet and make merry here. This year of grace witnessed
                        a somewhat different spectacle, it is true. It was a polyglot gathering of all nations, to be sure, but the tourist element was wanting. In the place of the tourists, however, was the "Army of Occupation." Hundreds of officers,
                        British, French, Egyptian, Australian and New Zealand, in smart uniforms, gave striking colour to the scene, which was made additionally picturesque by the vari-coloured silks and satins, scarfs and veils of the ladies. The garden
                        was a blaze of splendour. There were the flags of the nations, there were flowers and palms and purling fountains, mirth and music, lights and laughter, and over all—confetti. All night the air was thick with confetti, like snow
                        falling off a rainbow. Revellers flew hither and thither, flinging it everywhere. Merry maidens threw handfuls of confetti and eyesful of bold glances at the sun-tanned colonials. There was no respite until the ground was ankle-deep
                        with confetti.</p>
                    <p>But even a plague of locusts does not last for ever—and Egypt does. Egypt the wonderful! Egypt the kaleidoscopic! No, gentle reader, do not waste your sympathies on us. It was tiresome work, marching, training—training for the front,

                    <p>One charge was led by a doctor; another by a priest. Several times they charged so fiercely that they looked like getting out of hand. Scorning cover, they also scorned rifle fire. They scaled the steel-lined heights like demons. It
                        was the bayonet all the time. One huge farmer actually bayoneted a Turk through the chest and pitchforked him over his shoulder. The man who performed this feat was a huge Queenslander—Sergeant Burne, of the 9th Battalion, who
                        was afterwards wounded and returned to his Australian home—a man whose modesty is as great as his size. We smiled at first when we heard the story, and people in England and Australia read of it with amazement. But Sergeant Burne,
                        standing over six feet high, and massively proportioned, looks quite capable of the feat. He himself tells the story in these words: "It is not a case for me to take any credit at all," he said. "I was in the platoon that landed
                        first on the right. Our lieutenant was the first man to get ashore—and as game a man as ever faced fire. I followed him. I was ordered to take in hand a line of Turkish sharpshooters who were causing a lot of trouble. There was
                        also a machine-gun on the hill. Somebody had to stop it. Myself and two lads went up, and we stopped it. That's all. There were ten Turks there. We got the Turks and we got the machine-gun, but I lost my two lads. They were only
                        boys, but let me tell you the Australians are the best fighters in the world. One of the lads 'fixed' the German officer who was working the machine-gun. The Turks were higher up than we were, and I suppose that is how I was able
                        to throw one of them over my shoulder. It's an old trick that is taught in the Guards."</p>

                    <p>The casualties among the officers were tremendous—brave men who led Australia's soldiers in that awful charge! And among the bravest of them were the young officers from the Duntroon Military College that stands amid delightful country
                        surroundings near the capital of Federated Australia that is now in the making in the Mother State of New South Wales. These young fellows fought in a way that showed their native courage and the excellence of their training. Only
                        the year before, when Sir Ian Hamilton, as Inspector-General of the Oversea Forces, visited Australia and inspected these lads who were training for the army at Duntroon, as the representative of the Sydney Morning Herald I remember
                        seeing them laugh and cheer when Sir Ian Hamilton, on leaving Duntroon, jokingly wished them "plenty of wars and rapid promotion." And it seems only a few days since we were dancing and flirting in a Cairo ballroom. Now many of
                        them lie sorely wounded at the base hospital, and several will never again hear the réveillé. But the College will not forget its firstfruits offered up so gladly for empire. Officers and men, it was all the same—they went to their
                        death with a cheer for King and Country. I heard an Imperial officer, newly returned from Flanders, say that the 3rd Australian Infantry Brigade was the finest brigade of infantry in the whole of the allied armies. In physique
                        they were far superior to any of the British, French, or Belgian troops. Whether this be true or not, there is no doubt that the sturdy Thirds under Colonel Maclagan fought like Trojans on the Gallipoli Peninsula, and covered themselves
                        with glory. Incidentally, I might mention, some of them never fired a shot during the fierce fighting of April 25. They simply trusted to the cold steel, and flung themselves at the Turkish trenches. The 1st Brigade (Colonel MacLaurin),
                        the 2nd (Colonel McCay), and the rest of the Australians and New Zealanders fought with equal valour, but the brunt of the attack was borne by the Thirds. So many hundred gallant lives was a heavy price to pay for a footing in
                        Gallipoli, but those impetuous charges, absolutely irresistible in their fury, would, we knew, bear rich fruit, for the Turks could never again withstand a bayonet charge by the Australians.</p>
                    <p>To have gone through all they had gone through, and then to treat it all so lightly, seemed an extraordinary thing. All the doctors and nurses commented on the amazing fortitude and cheerfulness of the Australian wounded. I used to
                        think the desire to be in the thick of things, that I had so often heard expressed, was make-believe, but I know better now. I used to say myself that I "wanted to be there" (and sotto voce I used to add "I don't think"); and now,
                        in my heart-searchings, I began to wonder if I didn't really mean it, after all. I used to strike an attitude and quote, "One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name," whilst all the time I felt in my heart
                        that I would prefer a crowded age of glorious life to an hour of fame. Now I began to wonder whether in my heart's core, in my very heart of hearts, I did not agree with the poet. The proper study of mankind is Oneself. And what
                        was I doing there, anyway?</p>
                    <p>And now, a hundred years after, we see French and British warships again off Alexandria. But this time the Union Jack and the Tricolour are intertwined, and in the streets of Alexandria French and British soldiers and sailors walk
                        arm in arm, while the ancient city is gay with flags and bunting. For big things are brewing in the Levant. Before the eyes of the citizens during the past week was a unique international naval and military pageant—Zouaves, with
                        their blue jackets and red trousers, French infantry in their blue-grey uniform, cavalry with gay tunics, British Jack Tars in blue and white, Australians in sombre khaki, swarthy-skinned Maoris from the Wonderland of the Southern
                        Seas, and dusky warriors from the Punjab. British troops—and especially those young giants from Australia—had the better of the Frenchman in the matter of physique; but there was clear evidence of "grit" in the intelligent, humorous
                        faces of the French, which helped one to understand why, for instance, they are said to be the finest marchers in Europe, and why the Germans never got to Paris!</p>
